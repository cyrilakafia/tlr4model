# Applicability Domain
The mean and standard deviation for every compound with their descriptors were calculated.
The leverages of the compounds were then calculated from the mean and standard deviation.
After verification of the variance of the leverages above and below the threshold of 3, the applicability domain was calculated and test compunds marked as red pentagons had their leverages calculated and a graph obtained from the calculation.

## Final_train_sample.csv
This csv file used for the Applicability domain(AD) is the final train dataset after removal of descriptors with low variances.
