Building machine learning models for predicting inhibitors of the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)

## dataset
Datasets were obtained from pubchem assays AID 861 and AID 1237. 
AID 1237 is a confirmatory assays that further divides the actives from AID 861 into actives and inactives.

We are yet to decide which one we would use
